The purpose of this project is to write a small virtual machine that will emulate custom bytecode. Other tools, such as a compiler or a debugger will also be part of the project.

Of course, the main goal is to have fun, learn stuff, impress chicks, dive into dirty binaries and write vicious packers and crack-mes !
